This project was created with an interest in pathfinding algorithms, you can try the [Demo](https://jamaicanfriedchicken.github.io/path-finding-visualizer/) here.

# TODO

# Acknowledgements

This project started on a fundamental foundation that was created by [Clement](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaO6VoaYJv4kS-TQO_M-N_g) in React. This gave an insight on how I should approach and tackle my implementations for a pathfinding visualizer in React. Please check out his channel!
